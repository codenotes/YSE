Although YSE is released with the Mozilla Public License below, it does rely on Juce for some internal classes. Juce itself is released with a dual license: GPL for open source software and a commercial license for anything else. 

This means that if you are using YSE for a commercial product you are free to do so, but you should still acquire a commercial Juce license.
